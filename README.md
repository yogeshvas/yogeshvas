I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in human evolution.
We became too self aware; nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself.
We are creatures that should not exist by natural law.

We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, a secretion of sensory experience and feeling, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody’s nobody.
I think the honorable thing for our species to do is deny our programming, stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction, one last midnight, brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal.
